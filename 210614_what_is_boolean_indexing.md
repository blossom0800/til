# Boolean indexing is a type of indexing which uses actual values of the data in the DataFrame. In boolean indexing, we can filter a data in four ways â€“ 
 - Accessing a DataFrame with a boolean index
 - Applying a boolean mask to a dataframe
 - Masking data based on column value
 - Masking data based on index value
